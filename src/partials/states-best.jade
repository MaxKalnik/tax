        | Alaska tops our list of states whose residents get the most value for their tax dollars. State and local government expenditures on infrastructure and services exceed tax revenues by nearly 300%, with per capita expenditures surpassing per capita tax revenues by an amount equal to 12.38% of the average Alaskan’s income. This is made possible, on the one hand, by oil and gas revenues, and on the other, by the fact that unlike other states lacking a personal income tax, Alaska does impose an income tax on corporate incomes.

Per capita state and local government spending exceeds tax revenues payable by individual residents at a ratio of nearly 2 to 1; spending $3,395 more per New Mexican than it receives on a per capita basis. This amounts to a return on investment for a resident’s tax bill amounting to 7.46% of the average state resident’s income.

        | As with Alaska and New Mexico, tax revenue makes up one of the smallest slices of all state and local government revenues (number three, after second-place New Mexico and first-place Alaska), 35.82%. Nevertheless, Wyoming collects enough in sales and property taxes (sixth and seventh-place in per-capita terms) to offset its lack of personal or corporate income taxes. State and local governments in Wyoming are among the top spenders on education and highways over and above revenues generated by tuitions, tolls, and fees, with net benefits accumulating to the taxpayer amounting to a yearly bonus of 5.24% of the average resident’s income.

        | In fourth-place Kentucky, state and local government spending exceeds tax revenues collected from state residents by $2,079 per capita. Much of Kentucky’s tax revenue is generated through income taxation. Property taxes among the lowest in the country. Kentucky governments modestly outspend modest tax revenues, resulting in great value if not exceptional service.

        | With notoriously high taxes, New York is an unlikely, surprising addition to our list at number five. State and local governments in New York rank third both in expenditures and in tax revenues, across all tax categorie — including corporate income taxes. With most of the major players in the global economy doing business in New York City, corporate income tax revenues are a significant source of government funding. As such, government spending on items of value to the average taxpayer exceeds per capita tax revenues by an amount equal to 4.72% of the statewide average per capita income. Interestingly, with natural resource revenues in the 50th percentile and associated expenses lower than any other state but Virginia, New York comes the closest to making a profit on natural resources, before taxes paid by energy corporations are taken into account.

        | Like New York, sixth place Delaware is (legally) home to countless corporate entities, particularly in the city of Wilmington. As a result, Delaware likewise can rely on funds raised by means of corporate income taxes to fund spending in excess of revenues collected from individual taxpayers, who pay less in property taxes per capita than 44 states, and enjoy the benefits of no statewide sales tax.

        | Even though Oregonians pay the eighth highest personal income tax per capita, Oregon has an overall per capita tax burden just below the median for the nation, with tax revenues accounting for only 36.01% of all state and local government revenue. This is in part due to the non-existence of a state sales tax, and low alcoholic beverage taxes that are offset by the highly profitable state monopoly on liquor sales (second highest operating profits from state liquor stores). Meanwhile, state and local governments in Oregon invest heavily in parks and recreation facilities (while charging little for use), and has public safety and social services/insurance spending in or around the top quintile nationwide.

Despite paying a relatively large sum in taxes, Vermonters get back more than they pay, with state and local government spending in the top five nationally in categories such as education, highways, public welfare, and public health. Interestingly, the fact that only Vermont’s state and local governments lose money on liquor store sales does not significantly affect personal or public finances in the state.
